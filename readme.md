# Sudoku AI Solver

A Python implementation of a Sudoku solver using backtracking algorithm.

## Features
- Solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles
- Backtracking algorithm with validation checks
- Clear board visualization

## Next Steps ?
I'm planning to:

Add constraint propagation techniques

Implement a GUI interface

Optimize the algorithm further
